## Development
This app is built with the NativeScript CLI. Once you have the [CLI](https://docs.nativescript.org/start/quick-setup) installed, start by cloning the repo:  
```
git clone https://github.com/williamjuan027/nativescript-cardflip-demo
cd nativescript-cardflip-demo
```

From there you can use the `run` command to run the app on iOS:  
```
tns run ios
```

And the same command to run the app on Android:  
```
tns run android
```

**Note:** Cards are set up in the `card` directory with the the front and back components in their respective folders.
